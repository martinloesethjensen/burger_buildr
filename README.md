# burger_buildr

A simple burger building application.

It is also hosted on GitHub pages using [peanut](https://pub.dev/packages/peanut)

Access it [here](https://martinloesethjensen.github.io/burger_buildr/)

## Getting Started

Remember to have peanut activated: `flutter pub global activate peanut`

To generate and publish to GitHub pages use: 

- `make gh-pages`

or 

- `flutter pub global run peanut:peanut`

## Deployment on Skynet

I use [deploy to skynet action](https://github.com/kwypchlo/deploy-to-skynet-action) to automatically deploy to skynet for the hosting of web app.
